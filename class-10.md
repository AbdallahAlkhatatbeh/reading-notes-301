## Call stack 

A call stack is a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser) to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions — what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function, etc.

When a script calls a function, the interpreter adds it to the call stack and then starts carrying out the function.
Any functions that are called by that function are added to the call stack further up, and run where their calls are reached.
When the current function is finished, the interpreter takes it off the stack and resumes execution where it left off in the last code listing.
If the stack takes up more space than it had assigned to it, it results in a "stack overflow" error. 

function greeting() {
   // [1] Some codes here
   sayHi();
   // [2] Some codes here
}
function sayHi() {
   return "Hi!";
}

// Invoke the `greeting` function
greeting();

// [3] Some codes here

### Understanding the JavaScript call stack 
The JavaScript engine (which is found in a hosting environment like the browser), is a single-threaded interpreter comprising of a heap and a single call stack. The browser provides web APIs like the DOM, AJAX, and Timers.

This article is aimed at explaining what the call stack is and why it is needed. An understanding of the call stack will give clarity to how “function hierarchy and execution order” works in the JavaScript engine.

The call stack is primarily used for function invocation (call). Since the call stack is single, function(s) execution, is done, one at a time, from top to bottom. It means the call stack is synchronous.

The understanding of the call stack is vital to Asynchronous programming (which we will look at in a later article).

In Asynchronous JavaScript, we have a callback function, an event loop, and a task queue. The callback function is acted upon by the call stack during execution after the call back function has been pushed to the stack by the event loop.

But before we jump the gun, let us first attempt to answer the question - What is the call stack?

At the most basic level, a call stack is a data structure that uses the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle to temporarily store and manage function invocation (call).

Let’s break down our definition:

LIFO: When we say that the call stack, operates by the data structure principle of Last In, First Out, it means that the last function that gets pushed into the stack is the first to be pop out, when the function returns.

### JavaScript error messages && debugging 

Most of your time as a developer is spent reading code followed by debugging that same code, most likely to be able to read it or solve an “unexpected feature” (which, joking aside, is more correctly known as a “bug”). 

This is a sample of an error, the green is the overall error message, the light blue is to note if the error was properly handled, the brownish (dark yellow) is the type of error and the red is the call stack
The code that was run was the following (this is code for example purposes):
(function testing(){
  var obj = {
    add
  }
  function add(a, b) {
    var result = a + b
    return result.split('')
  }
  var stringResult = obj.add("1", "2")
  var result = obj.add(1, 2)
})()
I will come back to this code in the call stack section, let us first see what the types of error can be. 

###  Types of error messages
- Reference errors 
- Syntax errors 
- Range errors 
- Type errors 


 ### Debugging 

 To debug your JS code, the easiest and maybe the most common way its to simply console.log() the variables you want to check or, by using chrome developer tools, open your page with your JS code (press cmd+o in macOS or Ctrl+o in Windows) and choose your file to debug, click the line you wanna debug and refresh your page again (F5).
If the line you selected was run you will be able to see what has happened before that point and you can try and evaluate the next lines to check if everything is outputting what you are expecting.
The breakpoint can also be achieved by putting a debugger statement in your code in the line you want to break.
