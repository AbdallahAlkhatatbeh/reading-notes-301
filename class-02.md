## jQuery 
jQuery offers a simple way to achieve a variety of common
JavaScript tasks quickly and consistently, across all major
browsers and without any fallback code needed.  

 ## WHY USE JQUERY?
jQuery doesn't do anything you cannot achieve with pure JavaScript.
It is just a JavaScript file but estimates show it has been used on over a
quarter of the sites on the web, because it makes coding simpler. 

## GETTING ELEMENT CONTENT 

The • htm 1 () and • text () methods both retrieve and update the content
of elements. This page will focus on how to retrieve element content.  

### UPDATING ELEMENTS  
- . html() 
- . text() 
- .replaceWith()
-  . remove() 



### LOADING JQUERY FROM A CDN 
When a page loads jQuery from
a CDN, you will often see a
syntax like the one shown below.
It starts with a <script> tag that
tries to load the jQuery file from
the CDN. But note that the URL
for the script starts with two
forward slashes (not http:).
